0.2.1 (2019-06-05)
------------------
* Restream buffered frames with minimum publish rate (`#88 <https://github.com/RobotWebTools/web_video_server/issues/88>`_)
  * Restream buffered frames with minimum publish rate
  * Implement restreaming for ros_compressed_streamer
* Update travis config (`#89 <https://github.com/RobotWebTools/web_video_server/issues/89>`_)

0.2.0 (2019-01-30)
------------------
* Add "default_stream_type" parameter (`#84 <https://github.com/RobotWebTools/web_video_server/issues/84>`_)
  This allows users to specify default stream type in their .launch files. Using a "ros_compressed" stream type sometimes
  results in a much lower resource consumption, and having it set as a default is much nicer for end users.
